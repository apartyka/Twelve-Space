# Getting started

Include `twelve-space.scss`, `_twelve-space__helper-classes.scss` and `_variables.scss` in your projects Sass directory. It is recommended to change it to a partial (put a "_" in front of the file name). Adjust variables to control output naming convention and toggle %placeholder selectors or output selectors.

`@import "twelve-space";` in your main Sass file.
